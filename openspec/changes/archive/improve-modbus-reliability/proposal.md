This proposal aims to enhance the robustness of the Modbus communication within the Home Assistant integration. The primary objectives are to implement retry mechanisms for transient communication failures and to improve the handling of timeouts. This will ensure more reliable data acquisition from the inverter, aligning with the core requirement of successful Modbus connection and operation.
